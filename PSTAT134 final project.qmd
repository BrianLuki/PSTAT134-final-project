## Introduction 

**Write here**

### Inspiration and Motive

**Write here**

### Data Description

**Write here**
Since we don't require real time data, and Yelp fusion with enough attributes are restricted to business owners only, we use the open source fixed dataset that Yelp provides.

Link that we download the datset from: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download

## Methodology

**Write here**
**Read the Reading about unsupervised learning first**
**List out all the models we use**

## Load and Clean the Dataset

**Write here**

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)

# Load and inspect the datasets
business = stream_in(file("C:/D/homework/PSTAT 134/data/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json"))
tip = stream_in(file("C:/D/homework/PSTAT 134/data/yelp_academic_dataset_tip.json"))

# See if reviews can be useful, if not stick to what we have

```
